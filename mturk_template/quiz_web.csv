Band leader Billy Corgan has noted that—similar to the band's previous release, ""Oceania""—the album was the final part of the project ""Teargarden by Kaleidyscope"", due to cancellation of the project in 2018 by Corgan. The album received generally positive reviews from music critics, but sold poorly compared to the band's previous albums, peaking at number 33 in the U.S. and number 59 in the U.K., thus making it (at the time) their lowest charting album in both regions since their debut, ""Gish"" (1991).||||William Patrick Corgan Jr. (born March 17, 1967) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and professional wrestling promoter. He is best known as the lead singer, primary songwriter, guitarist, and only permanent member of the rock band the Smashing Pumpkins. He is currently the owner and promoter of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) promotion.||||Formed by Corgan and guitarist James Iha in Chicago in 1988, the Smashing Pumpkins quickly gained steam with the addition of bassist D'arcy Wretzky and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin. Strong album sales and large-scale tours propelled the band's increasing fame in the 1990s until their break-up in 2000. Corgan started a new band called Zwan, and after their demise he released a solo album, ""TheFutureEmbrace"", in 2005 and a collection of poetry, ""Blinking with Fists"", before reforming the Smashing Pumpkins.

His government supported the colonization of Poland by German settlers, contributing to the plight of rural Poland depicted in Bolesław Prus's novel *The Outpost*, which brought attention to ""poverty, ignorance, neglect by the country's upper crust, and colonization by German settlers backed by Wilhelm I's German government"" [1].","The Outpost (Polish title: ""Placówka"") was the first of four major novels by the Polish writer Bolesław Prus. The author, writing in a Poland that had been partitioned a century earlier by Russia, Prussia and Austria, sought to bring attention to the plight of rural Poland, which had to contend with poverty, ignorance, neglect by the country's upper crust, and colonization by German settlers backed by Otto von Bismarck's German government.||||Otto Eduard Leopold, Prince of Bismarck, Duke of Lauenburg (born von Bismarck-Schönhausen; ; 1 April 1815 – 30 July 1898), known as Otto von Bismarck (] ( ) ), was a conservative German statesman who masterminded the unification of Germany in 1871 and served as its first chancellor until 1890, in which capacity he dominated European affairs for two decades. He had previously been Minister President of Prussia (1862–1890) and Chancellor of the North German Confederation (1867–1871). He provoked three short, decisive wars against Denmark, Austria, and France. Following the victory against Austria, he abolished the supranational German Confederation and instead formed the North German Confederation as the first German national state, aligning the smaller North German states behind Prussia. Receiving the support of the independent South German states in the Confederation's defeat of France, he formed the German Empire (which excluded Austria) and united Germany.||||With Prussian dominance accomplished by 1871, Bismarck skillfully used balance of power diplomacy to maintain Germany's position in a peaceful Europe. To historian Eric Hobsbawm, Bismarck ""remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic chess for almost twenty years after 1871, [and] devoted himself exclusively, and successfully, to maintaining peace between the powers"". However, his annexation of Alsace-Lorraine (Elsaß-Lothringen) gave new fuel to French nationalism and Germanophobia. This helped set the stage for the First World War. Bismarck's diplomacy of ""Realpolitik"" and powerful rule at home gained him the nickname the ""Iron Chancellor"". German unification and its rapid economic growth was the foundation to his foreign policy. He disliked colonialism but reluctantly built an overseas empire when it was demanded by both elite and mass opinion. Juggling a very complex interlocking series of conferences, negotiations and alliances, he used his diplomatic skills to maintain Germany's position.",c5f21e4bcacfe6afdc245568116058f84f1a063f,"What race did the sister of the author of ""Down from the Mountaintop: From Belief to Belonging"" identify as?",expanded_answer,"Rachel Dolezal, the sister of the author of ""Down from the Mountaintop: From Belief to Belonging,"" identified as black, despite being born to white parents[3].

The book was described by Kim Barnes as an ""intimate and lyrical story of fallen faith, found love, and the way we must sometimes circle back to find what we have lost.""||||Dolezal was president of the NAACP chapter in Spokane, Washington, from 2014 until June 2015, when she resigned in the midst of controversy over her racial identity. She received public scrutiny when her white parents publicly stated that she was passing as black. The statement by Dolezal's parents followed Dolezal's reports to police and local news media that she had been the victim of race-related hate crimes; however, a subsequent police investigation had failed to substantiate her allegations. Dolezal had also identified herself as mixed-race on an application and had claimed that an African-American man was her father. In the aftermath of the controversy, Dolezal was dismissed from her position as an instructor in Africana Studies at Eastern Washington University and was removed from her post as chair of the Police Ombudsman Commission in Spokane over ""a pattern of misconduct"". Later in 2015, Dolezal acknowledged that she had been ""born white to white parents"", but maintained that she self-identified as black.||||The Dolezal controversy fueled a national debate in the United States about racial identity. Dolezal's critics stated that she committed cultural appropriation and fraud; Dolezal and her defenders asserted that her self-identification is genuine, even though it is not based on ancestry.

Due to urban expansion, the fortress eventually lost its defensive function, and in 1546 Francis I converted it into the primary residence of the French Kings. The building was extended many times to form the present Louvre Palace. In 1682, Louis XIV chose the Palace of Versailles for his household, leaving the Louvre primarily as a place to display the royal collection, including, from 1692, a collection of ancient Greek and Roman sculpture. In 1692, the building was occupied by the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres and the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture, which in 1699 held the first of a series of salons.

Inspired in 1830 when Peter Cooper learned about the government-supported École Polytechnique in France, Cooper Union was established in 1859. The school was built on a radical new model of American higher education based on founder Peter Cooper's fundamental belief that an education ""equal to the best technology schools established"" should be accessible to those who qualify, independent of their race, religion, sex, wealth or social status, and should be ""open and free to all.""||||Cooper envisioned his school replacing the declining master/apprentice system with a higher form of education suited to a new age.
